# TestNG-Sample-JAVA-POM

Sample project created to demostrate my knowledge in using TestNG as test framework and Java as programming language with Page-Object-Model as design Pattern.

The application used is from sauce labs where it has login, add to cart, and checkout function.

The goal is to crate a test for individual functions of the pages.

The test only covers happy path.
